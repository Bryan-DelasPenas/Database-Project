If you are running the database for the first time, run the following scripts in order,

1) Project_DB_CreateDB     -- Creates the database
2) Project_DB_CreateTables -- Creates the tables
3) Project_DB_InsertTable  -- Inserts data into table 
4) Project_DB_DropTable    -- Deletes all tables
5) Project_DB_Querries     -- Allows for queries 1 - 8 to run
6) Project_DB_Transacations-- Allows for the 9) function and 10) trigger to run
Inside of this milestone, I have created the user portion, that has connected to my Database
and allows for all of these commands to be run inside of a Notebook
